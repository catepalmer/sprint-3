-  What is you site's primary purpose?

To act as a record of my progress on my Dev academy journey.


-  Who is your target audience?

Other beginner web developers and EDA Phase 0 students


-  How do you want site visitors to interact with your site? What experience would you like them to have?

I’d like the site to be easy and straightforward to navigate, but also visually appealing and interesting (as the content may be a bit boring…).


-  How will you build your site to support your desired user experience?

I want to think about layout in a way that takes into account how users’ eyes typically navigate a page, and work usability etc into my design.
