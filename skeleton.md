- What happens to the layout when you resize the screen to less than 550 px. How do you think that works?

When you resize the screen to less than 550 px, the layout you see should be the layout intended for mobile devices, and any features added/changed for minimum widths of 550 px and above should disappear, leaving only the base styling (as Skeleton uses mobile-first design).
